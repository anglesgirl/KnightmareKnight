 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin requires YEP_QuestJournal. Make sure this plugin is located
 * under YEP_X_MoreQuests1 in the plugin list.
 *
 * By default, the YEP_QuestJournal plugin comes with 100 quest entries that
 * you can make and insert into your game. And depending on the RPG being made,
 * 100 quest entries just might not be enough. This plugin is a part of a
 * series of extension plugins made for the Yanfly Engine Plugins Quest Journal
 * System to allow for a higher quest quantity than just 100.
 *
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests1 will add quests 101 to 1000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests2 will add quests 1001 to 2000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests3 will add quests 2001 to 3000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests4 will add quests 3001 to 4000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests5 will add quests 4001 to 5000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests6 will add quests 5001 to 6000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests7 will add quests 6001 to 7000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests8 will add quests 7001 to 8000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests9 will add quests 8001 to 9000.
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests10 will add quests 9001 to 10000.
 *
 * These extension plugins also come with a new feature: automatic batch data.
 * For every set of 100 quests, you can set a default type, difficulty, from,
 * and location data for them. Quest entries that have |-=AUTO=-| in those
 * respective fields will draw data from the batch set's default data. How you
 * wish to use this will be up to you!

 * ===========================================================================
 * 導入
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * このプラグインはYEP_QuestJournalを必要とします。
 * プラグイン管理のYEP_QuestJournalの下に
 * このプラグインがあることを確認してください。
 *
 * YEP_QuestJournalプラグインには、
 * 作成してゲームに挿入できる100個のクエストエントリが付属しています。
 * RPGによっては、100個のクエストエントリーでは足りないかもしれません。
 * このプラグインは、
 * YEP_QuestJournal用に作られた一連の拡張プラグインの一部で、
 * 100よりも多いクエスト量を可能にします。
 *
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 1はクエスト 101から1000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 2はクエスト1001から2000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 3はクエスト2001から3000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 4はクエスト3001から4000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 5はクエスト4001から5000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 6はクエスト5001から6000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 7はクエスト6001から7000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 8はクエスト7001から8000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests 9はクエスト8001から9000を追加します。
 * YEP_X_MoreQuests10はクエスト9001から10000を追加します。
 *
 * これらの拡張プラグインには新機能、自動バッチデータもついてきます。
 * 100個のクエストのセット毎に、
 * デフォルトのタイプ、難易度、差出人、場所データを設定できます。
 * |-=AUTO=-| を持つクエストエントリのフィールドには、
 * バッチセットのデフォルトデータからデータが表示されます。
 * これをどのように使うかはあなた次第です。
